    <h2>About Gentle Cuts</h2>
    <p>Gentle Cuts was an MP3 blog created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100905182124/http://gentlecuts.net/" target="_blank">in 2010</a> by Albin Karlsson and Tobias Gerhardsson. It was used for sharing music which they liked and found inspiring, and was active for nearly a decade.</p>
    <p>In 2019, gentlecuts.net returned an error message, ‚Äú<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190817063255/gentlecuts.net" target="_blank">This site has been temporarily disabled, please try again later.</a>‚Äù It hadn't been updated since October 31st, 2018, and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gentlecuts" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gentlecuts" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>, and <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/gentlecuts/" target="_blank">Mixcloud</a> accounts showed no activity. Presumably, the domain expired shortly after the site was disabled.</p>
    <p>After nearly four years of silence, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gentlecuts/posts/pfbid046boWF9Yg2xB8nMZPQViKKLE95j5noN7hmkPxV58e5cuubJ9zjRTCYneGJ2vFVkDl" target="_blank">new post</a> was made on the Gentle Cuts Facebook page, "<i>Hello dear followers! Gentle Cuts is officially resurrected on Instagram. We'll be posting favourites from previous years as well as newly found tracks as we go. Would love to see some of our faithful followers (you) joining us on this journey as well! üìÄ üíã</i>". The Instagram account was updated regularly between July 27th and August 3rd, 2022. There hasn't been any activity anywhere since then.</p>
    <p>The website's disappearance and domain expiration are currently unaddressed, leaving uncertainty about whether it was WordPress or the owners that took it down. Like many old and long-running projects, was it simply just forgotten, or abandoned?</p>
    <p>Since December 26, 2023, gentlecuts.net shows this page.</p>
